# thesis_data
Code generated during thesis. Uploaded only code that was used in the final report of the thesis. 

This code is definitly unpolished. I however believe that in 2023 we should not be putting large pieces of code in appendices anymore, and a online environment is more suited.

Run in Python 3.10, NumPy 1.24.0, SciPy 1.9.3 and Matplotlib 3.6.2.

More code has been generated during thesis but has not been used in the final thesis and has hence not been reported.
